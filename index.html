               While traveling across the United Kingdom in the summer of 2016, I kept an extremely detailed
               journal with every place, meal, and conversation that I experienced. I wanted to
               remember the places I went, but more importantly I wanted to tell my stories.
               <br />
               <br />
               Captain's Log is a tool to facilitate me in my quest to become a better storyteller. It serves as
               a reminder of the moments in my life, not the stories themselves. The goal is to quickly
               capture important details from moments so that the stories themselves are not lost in the
               abyss of my memory.
               <br  />
               <br  />
               10/03/2016
               Version 1.0 of Captain's Log has been completed. It allows users to create, edit, delete, tag, and search
               moments. Core data is implemented to allow for the persistence of the moments when the app is closed or
               the phone is turned off. The repository is currently private on Github, but if you are interested in gaining
               access to it please shoot me an email.
               <br />
               Next steps:
               <ul>
                  <li>Add more advanced sorting features</li>
                  <li>Clean up code</li>
                  <li>Save database of moments to iCloud</li>
                  <li>Create a macOS App that syncs with the iOS App</li>
               </ul>

               Working on an app to keep track of how recently events have occurred. This application
               was mostly created as a practice for learning Objective-C. However, this project might
               be considered the initial prototype of Captain's Log.
